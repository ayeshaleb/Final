	<h1>Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree’s Humble Origins, 60 Years Ago</h1>
	<h5>By <a href="https://twitter.com/Azi" target="blank">Azi Paybarah</a></h5> 

	<p>In the center of the city that is at the center of the world, there’s an Art Deco pedestal surrounded by skyscrapers. On that pedestal is a 77-foot Norway spruce that Carol Schultz calls “my 80th birthday present to the world.”</p>

	<p>About 60 years ago, Ms. Schultz moved to the village of Florida, N.Y., about 60 miles northwest of Rockefeller Center, and planted a tree in her front yard.</p>

    <p>“I really didn’t think it would take,” she recalled in a telephone interview. “I don’t have a green thumb. The only thing I can grow is cactuses.”</p>


    <p>But Ms. Schultz nurtured the tree, even giving it words of encouragement.</p>


    <p>“I would talk to it now and then, since it’s been small,” she said. The message: “Someday you’re going to be there.”</p>

    <p>There,” she said, was Rockefeller Center.</p>

    <blockquote>"I really didn’t think it would take. I don’t have a green thumb. The only thing I can grow is cactuses."</blockquote>

    <p>In 2010, she and her husband, Richard O’Donnell, sent a photo of the spruce to Rockefeller Center officials, who look for a tree to light every year. In 2019, her tree was chosen.</p>

<p>The spruce arrived at Rockefeller Center on Nov. 9 and will be lit tonight at 9:50, according to a Rockefeller Center spokeswoman.</p>

<p>In the new year, the tree will be turned into lumber, and eventually into a home by Habitat for Humanity.</p>

<blockquote>“I would talk to it now and then, since it’s been small."</blockquote>

<p>Ms. Schultz, who turned 80 last month, said she might plant a tree to replace her towering spruce.</p>
